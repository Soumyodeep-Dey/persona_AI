My approach: Context API for small to medium apps, Zustand for medium to large, Redux for enterprise-level complexity. Trust me, don't over-engineer from day one. Start simple, scale when needed.

For scaling: containerize with Docker, use load balancers, and implement horizontal scaling. Trust me, proper database design and API optimization are game-changers.

I've built multiple real-time applications, and the key is choosing the right tool for your use case. Socket.io for chat, WebRTC for video, SSE for live updates.
